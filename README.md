*  React Photo Portfolio

*  Description: Front-end web application for a WordPress backend photography portfolio site. 
****************************/

This is a personal project to learn React, CSS grid layout, to get familiar with the 
WordPress REST API, and to get familiar with github. It combines my interest in coding 
and photography, and will serve as a portfolio for both once finished. Hopefully this can 
also eventually be put out into the community for others to use.
