*  Photo Portfolio Application

*  Author: Dave Feucht
*  Version: 1.0
*  Description: Front-end web application for a WordPress backend photography portfolio site. 
*   This is a personal project to learn React, CSS grid layout, to get familiar with the 
*   WordPress REST API, and to get familiar with github. It combines my interest in coding 
*   and photography, and will serve as a portfolio for both once finished. Hopefully this can 
*   also be put out into the community for others to use.
